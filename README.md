#  Olivia Pinney's Data Vizualization Porfolio
This is the root repository for Olivia Pinney's Data Vizualization portfolio through the UChicago, Fall 2022 data visualization course. I started this project with no experience in HTML, JavaScript and D3. Over the next three weeks I hope to create some through provoking visualizations using these three languages. You can follow my progressions in this repository.
