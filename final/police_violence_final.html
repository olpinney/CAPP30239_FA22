        Exploring Use of Force in the Chicago Police Department
    </h1></div>
    <p>

        Spurred by the magnitude of police killings of unarmed black civilians, America is reconning with violence at the hands of the police. This website gives you the opportunity to explore data on police violence yourself. 
    </p><p>
        This data was obtained from <a href="https://github.com/invinst/chicago-police-data">The Invisible Institute</a>, which sued the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to get these records released to the public. The data includes data on the police roster, police use of force, and civilian complaints through 2016.  
    </p><p>
        This document will help you understand variables contained in this dataset, and prepare you to explore them using the followng bubble chart type:

    <p>
        We often talk about police officers as a monolith, but this is not the case. 
        The police are broken into over a hundred departments. 
        Most officers work in police districts, which encompass beat officers and general 911 reponse. 
        The remaining officers are distributed across departments at the city level. Some work as detectives, others in public transports, evidence management or training new recruits.

    <div class="background_grey">
        <h1>Variable 2: Tactical responses</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Most violence at the hands of the police is sanctioned by the state. 
        The police are hired to perform take downs (e.g. tackling), closed hand punches, knee strikes, kicks, and more. These are classified as uses of force.
        Police are also licensed to use weapons against civilians: namely tasers, pepper spray, batons and firearms. These are classified separately as use of weapon.  
    </p><p>
        Everytime such an altercation takes place, the officer writes a self-report of the incident. 
        These reports are included in the Invisible Institute dataset.  
    </p><p>
        The data below contains all use of force and weapon reports from 2004 to mid-2016 for all officers employeed by the CPD in 2016. I have additionally excluded officers that are still in recruit training, given that they are not representative of the broader police force.

        <h1>Variable 3: Civilian and Departmental Complaints</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Civilian and departmental complaints form the starting point at which the state considers the permisability of police actions. 
        These complaints come in many forms. Officers can recieve departmental complaints for a uniform infraction or for using too much overtime. 
        They can also recieve more severe departmental complaints, including neglect of duty and conduct unbecoming.  
    </p>
        Civilian complaints are submitted for a wide range of issues. 
        I categorized them into four bucket areas. 
        Use of Force / Weapon complaints includes excessive or unnecessary force, weapon usage, injury and death.
        Handling of Arrest / Detainment consists of primarily unlawful searches, illegal arrests and confiscation of property. 
        Bigotry / Verbal abuse is primarily profanity or abusive language regarding race, ethicity or sexual orientation.  
        Criminal Activity is most commonly domestic altercations off duty, but also includes theft, possession or sale of controlled substances and sex offenses. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This data includes all complaints submitted between 2000 and 2016, excluding officers that are still in recruit training.

        <h1>Data Exploration</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Now that you are familiar with the makeup and variables for measuring police violence, you can explore the data for yourself.
        Try looking at different departments, and see how use of force versus civilian complaints are distributed across the department. 
    </p><p>
        You can see that, in most departments, a small number of officers use a force far more frequently than the rest of their department. 
        However, these officers are not anomalies: this distribution of violence is consistent across departments. 
        Additionally, the concentration of civilian and departmental complaints does not line up neatly with use of force frequency.
    </p><p>
    Thus, police violence cannot be soley attributed to individual "bad apples". Addressing police violence requires us acknowledge the variety and wide distribution of violence at the hands of the police.
