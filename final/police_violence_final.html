        Exploring Use of Force in the Chicago Police Department
    </h1></div>

            <p>
                Spurred by the magnitude of police killings of unarmed black civilians, America is grappling with the issues of violence 
                at the hands of the police. This website gives individuals the opportunity to explore data on police violence themselves. 
            </p><p>
                This exploration is made possible by the <a href="https://github.com/invinst/chicago-police-data">The Invisible Institute</a>, 
                 which sued the Chicago Police Department (CPD) in 2016 to get records released after the police killing of Laquan McDonald.  
                 This dataset is a rare window into police internal records: including the police roster, police self-reported use of force incidents, and civilian complaints. 
            </p><p>
                For example, the following chart shows the police officers of Chicago's 1st Police District in 2016.
                It displays police officers using two different measures of police violence: 
                the color and x-axis show self-reported incidents of violence by the police, while the bubble sizes show the number of civilian complaints each officer received over the disclosed window.

                The chart shows that a small number of officers (in orange) use force or weapons with disproportionate frequency. 
                For example, Officer Hansen reported using force or weapons 95 times over the 12 year reporting period. 
            <p></p>
                On the other hand, there are many officers who have never reported using force or a weapon, with the majority of officers reporting 1-20 incidents of force or weapon usage. 
            </p><p>
                The theory of bad-apple policing suggests that the majority of egregious police violence is perpetuated by a few outlier cops; 
                however, this narrative is overly simplistic. This page explores how other measures of police violence - such as civilian complaints -
                do not separate neatly between a few violent cops and cops that do not enact violence.

                The police are often discussed as a monolith, but the data shows that police work differs drastically by department. 
                In 2016, the CPD officers were divided into 78 departments. Most officers worked in police districts, which include beat officers and general 911 response. 
                The remaining officers were distributed other departments. Some work as detectives, others in public transports, evidence management or training new recruits.

    <section class="section-container">
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Most violence at the hands of the police is state sanctioned. 
                The police are hired to perform take downs (e.g. tackling), wristlocks, closed hand punches, knee strikes, kicks, and more. These are classified as uses of force.
                Police are also licensed to use weapons against civilians: namely tasers, pepper spray, batons, and firearms. These are classified separately as use of weapon.  
            </p><p>
                Every time an altercation takes place, the officer writes a self-report of the incident, called a Tactical Response Report (TRR).
                The Invisible Institute released all reports created in the 12 years between 2004 and 2016. 
                These reports speak to the frequency with which police officers use force over the course of their careers. 
            </p><p>
                The chart below speaks to the amount of force used by the average Chicago police officer over their career so far. 
                The reporting window does not include data before 2004, so the following charts only contain force and weapons usage from the prior 12 years: from 2004 to 2016.
                The analysis is limited to CPD officers employed in 2016, and excludes officers in recruit training.

            <p>
            Civilian and departmental complaints are the starting point at which the state considers the permissibility of police actions. 
                These complaints come in many forms. Officers can receive departmental complaints for a uniform infraction or for using too much overtime. 
                They can also receive more severe departmental complaints, including neglect of duty and conduct unbecoming.  
            </p>
            Civilian complaints are submitted for a wide range of issues, which have been categorized into four bucket areas: 
            </br><strong>Use of Force / Weapon</strong> includes excessive or unnecessary force, weapon usage, injury and death.
            </br><strong>Handling of Arrest / Detainment</strong> consists of primarily unlawful searches, illegal arrests and confiscation of property. 
            </br><strong>Bigotry / Verbal Abuse</strong> is primarily profanity or abusive language regarding race, ethnicity or sexual orientation.  
            </br><strong>Criminal Activity</strong> is most commonly domestic altercations off duty, but also includes theft, possession or sale of controlled substances and sex offenses. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The following chart includes all complaints submitted between 2000 and 2016, excluding officers that are still in recruit training.

            <p>Now that you are familiar with the CPD department breakdown and variables for measuring police violence, you can explore the data for yourself. 
            </p><p>
                Try looking at different departments and see how use of force is distributed.
                You can see that, in most departments, a small number of officers use force far more frequently than the rest of their department. 
                However, this distribution of violence is not an anomaly: this distribution is consistent across departments. 
                
            </p><p>
                Try looking at the distribution of complaints. You can see that use of force frequency does not line up neatly with any complaint type. 
            </p><p>
                Finally, try reading the biography of individual officers. Can these officers by sorted into the categories of "bad apples" and non-violent police?
