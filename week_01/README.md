I am a second year masters student in the MSCAPP program at Harris. I am originally from New York, and am new to Chicago (as of last year). I do not have any cats or dogs, but I consider my four plants to be my pets (hence the green dots). After graduate school, I am interested in doing data analytics for local government.
