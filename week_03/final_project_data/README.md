
Data source: The Invisible Institute's FOIA Data on Police Misconduct 

Description of data
This data covers instances of police use of force in Chicago between 2004 and 2016. It is part of a broader set of tables on police misconduct, which I am exploring for an outside project. This csv may not be the final form of this data because I might merge it in with other variables from other datasets. In its current form, the dataset has 67,000 instances of police use of force. It has variables on where, when, under which conditions, and severity of force used. 

Why you are interested in this topic
I am interested in this dataset because of outside work regarding understanding police use of force. My primary interest is invesigating how the average person thinks about the police's contribution to safety versus violence. 

Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data
There are a bunch of potential directions to go with this data. Currently, I am interseted in looking at it geographically, and quantifying frequency of different scenarios occuring. 

Potential data points
For the above vizualizations, I would use block, street, and police beat for geography. I would use rows H:X to break down the data into scenarios. 

Any concerns about the data
Luckily the invisible institute has done a lot of work aggregating and cleaning this data, which saves me concerns. 

Identify if source is primary or secondary
This source is primary because it was recieved through government littigation by Invisible Institute against the City of Chicago.
